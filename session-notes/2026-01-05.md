# AI Things Considered - Development Diary
## January 5, 2026

### The Idea

Started with a simple concept: what if NPR's All Things Considered became a daily comic strip? Six panels, vintage newspaper aesthetic, generated by AI.

### Research Phase

- Investigated Cloudflare Workers AI (10k neurons/day free tier) but decided against it
- Landed on **Gemini 3 Pro** for image generation via Google AI Studio
- Confirmed free tier: 500 images/day — more than enough for 6 daily panels
- Found NPR RSS feed: `https://feeds.npr.org/2/rss.xml`
- Verified ATC transcripts available same-day (pushed back on my 48-hour claim)

### Building the Pipeline

1. **Story fetching** - RSS parser pulls ~20 daily stories
2. **Story selection** - Gemini Flash picks 6 based on visual potential, topic diversity, significance
3. **Prompt generation** - LLM translates news → vintage comic panel descriptions
4. **Image generation** - Gemini 3 Pro renders each panel (2:3 aspect ratio, 1K)
5. **Composition** - PIL/Pillow assembles 3x2 grid with Oswald font title

### Design Decisions

- **Reference images for politicians** - Gemini won't generate recognizable figures from text alone. Solution: manifest.json with photos + feature descriptions
- **Left-justified Oswald font** - Matching benolsen.com aesthetic
- **GitHub over Cloudinary** - Version controlled, public, free to use
- **Clickable panels** - CSS grid overlay links each panel to original NPR story

### First Comic Generated

Successfully generated and deployed the first comic featuring:
1. Nicolás Maduro overthrown
2. Maduro pleads not guilty
3. Kremlin condemns U.S. operation
4. Hospital patient saves another
5. Homeless advocate opens warming center
6. 90-year-old stage performers

### Website Integration

- New "AI" section added to benolsen.com (section 02, after About)
- Placeholder panels for future projects: News 2 MTV, AI Thoughts, Silly Stuff
- Updated README with comic display and "free to use" notice

### Repo Split

Separated concerns into two repositories:

**benolsen.com** (display)
- `comics/ai-things-considered/*.png` and `*.json`
- Website with clickable comic panels

**AI-Things-Considered** (generation)
- `execution/ai_things_considered.py`
- `prompts/story_to_image_prompt.md`
- `ai_things_considered.md` directive

### What's Next

- Manual runs for one week to validate
- Then: automation (cron or GitHub Action)
- Update website HTML/JSON dynamically as new comics are added

*Total time: one session. From idea to deployed comic strip with full pipeline.*
